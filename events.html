                Designed exclusively for XLRI students, Apollo is a cross domain event that is conducted during the fest. Hosted by three committees on campus namely SAPPHIRE (Students’ Association for the Promotion of Personnel Management, Human Resources and Industrial Relations), CRUX (The Consulting and Research Undertaking) and FIRE@X (The Forum for Industrial Relations), the event witnesses participation from teams comprising both the HRM and BM students. <br/>
                It starts off with an online quiz where teams participated with overwhelming zeal and enthusiasm to crack some challenging questions on human resources and industrial relations. Post the online battle, sixteen teams qualify for the next leg, where SAPPHIRE, FIRE@X and CRUX have their separate events.<br/>
                Ensemble 2016 saw the second round filled with vigor and razzmatazz throughout the event where the teams competed in a treasure hunt for SAPPHIRE’s event. Teams were judged both on their agility during the hunt and their subject expertise. <br/>
                This event provided exposure and learning opportunities in diverse areas of human resource management and industrial relations to all the participants. A success, this event was a joy ride yet a new learning experience.

                One of the primary aims of SAPPHIRE is to keep the students updated with the emerging industry trends in the HR area. A similar attempt was made when they launched their annual quizzing league “Battle H Royale” in 2016. A power packed event consisting of five rounds, this event gathers participation of over 1000 candidates from the premium B-Schools of the country every year. The event sees the students knuckling down to decipher the questions thrown at them at each round to maintain their position on the leader board where the points from each round is added. The battle ends with the finale conducted in the National HR IR Conference every year.

            Human Resource Management is arguably one of the most important facets of management and management education. Yet if you see the number of competitive engagements present in the space of HR as in comparison to other management disciplines, the ratio is rather regrettable. And it is in such a scenario that SAPPHIRE, the HR committee of XLRI Jamshedpur steps up to fill the void with a unique national level event HR Colosseum.<br/>
            A one of a kind event, HR Colosseum started in January 2017, as a national level HR event with a variety of innovative events designed to test the different competencies of participants as they square off against some of the brightest minds in the country.<br/> 
            Colosseum plays host to a plethora of engaging events as we at SAPPHIRE look towards fulfilling our goal of spreading awareness and interest in the field of Human Resource Management across the length and breadth of the country.

                        With the ‘silver tsunami’ facing us all, 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring per day, and Millennials are taking over the jobs, introducing the concepts such as the Gig Workforce. Hence, it has become imperative for the HR to understand how to adapt to the changes. These effects are not only seen in the corporate spaces, but also in the manufacturing set-ups with the paradigm shift in the workers as well. it will be extremely interesting to see what views do the leaders from the Human Resources and the Industrial Relations sectors, hold, and how do they intend to adapt to the future.<br/>
                        So as the workforce prepares itself to usher in these times of change, we at SAPPHIRE in XLRI are trying to give the platform for HR and IR leaders across the length and breadth of the country to congregate and try to reach a few useful insights shedding light to what this exciting new future may exactly look like. Further, there will be the brightest HR minds from the best institutions who will enrich the conference with their curiosity, ingenuity and brand new perspectives to view and provide solutions to problems and opportunities of the future.<br/>
                        Thus with this perfect combination of experienced professionals meeting bright students, we look forward to finding the perfect ways to realize the fullest potential of the workforce of the future, through discussions regarding the various methods HR-IR professionals have used to ride through and adapt to these changes. We will have talks from various dignitaries from the industry regarding how they have changed their approach to adapt to the changes in their fields. In addition to this, we will have paper presentations on various tracks, which will be considered for publication in XLRI’s esteemed journal, Management and Labour Studies (MLS), subject to rigorous scholarly view. <br/>

                    Being considered the best in the education business for Human Resources and Industrial Relations is not a legacy that can be continued merely through academics. Maintaining this stature requires the diligence of the brightest minds of the country who work together to brainstorm and come up with events that make XL what it is. The National HR IR Conference being conducted every year is one such effort of these young minds who work behind the scenes to enable the students receive inputs from the best in the industry.<br/><br/>

                    Does the HR need to redefine the processes and systems in place according to the changing needs of the changing workforce? How can we address this generational divide?</p>

                    <p><b><u>Consolidation of labour laws and its impact on HR - IR scenario in India</u></b></p>
                    <p>New labour law reforms aimed at increasing the ease of doing business, coupled with changing workforce aspirations, decreasing influence of unions in various industries and several other factors, is a testament to the fact that employment relations in our country have changed drastically. The central government plans to reduce 44 labour laws to just five as it seeks to make it easier for companies to do business in India. Once passed, these changes will significantly restructure India’s labour rules framework, where nearly a dozen laws related to social security will be merged to create a single social security law or code. As a result, all the stakeholders have had to adapt with times.</p>
                    <p>The workers, the trade union and the management are the basic parties to it and then it finds its most important application in the case of industrial disputes.</p>
                    <p>In this context, we will have a discussion on the challenges and opportunities that the initiative would provide for the workforce and businesses in the country. Which laws will be altered and how would that impact the rights of the workers?</p>
                    <p>The aim of this panel discussion is to let the students enrich & expand their learning from a discussion between industry stalwarts and academicians.</p>

                    <p>What is the gig economy? In the gig economy temporary positions are common. Instead of creating jobs, companies are increasingly disaggregating work from jobs. This enables them to contract with independent workers for short-term engagements rather than hire full-time employees, who are the most expensive and least flexible source of labour available. On one hand job security is no longer guaranteed, and the good wages, generous benefits and secure retirement that used to go hand in hand with full-time employment are in decline, gig workers enjoy greater choice, autonomy, flexibility, and control – all which drive greater worker satisfaction – than many of their full-time counterparts.</p>
                     
                    <div class="panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading">Track 2 - Impact of changes in Labour laws and current government policies on HR scenario in India</div></div>
                     
                    <p>India is in a transforming stage with current government policies focusing on labour reforms. The NDA government has put its weight behind ‘Make in India’ campaign. As part of these reforms, a series of new bills have been drafted/ introduced in the parliament, the latest being code on wages bill 2017. Some see these changes as a positive step towards encouraging employment generation and focus on production as the focus is on consolidation of labour laws in the country. The Confederation of Indian Industry has stated “We have been recommending these key reforms for bringing in simplification and flexibility in engagement and deployment of labour.” However, the government also faces a lot of roadblocks on its way. Its labour wing Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh has protested these proposed legislations. These laws will certainly influence the approach of HR across various sectors.</p>
                     
                    <p>The best submissions for each track will be selected for presentation in the conference.</p>

                <b>Fortifying the Future: Managing the Changing Workforce and its Needs</b>
                <br/><br/>
                With the ‘silver tsunami’ facing us all, 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring per day, and Millennials are taking over the jobs, introducing the concepts such as the Gig Workforce. Hence, it has become imperative for the HR to understand how to adapt to the changes. These effects are not only seen in the corporate spaces, but also in the manufacturing set-ups with the paradigm shift in the workers as well. it will be extremely interesting to see what views do the leaders from the Human Resources and the Industrial Relations sectors, hold, and how do they intend to adapt to the future.<br/>
                So as the workforce prepares itself to usher in these times of change, we at SAPPHIRE in XLRI are trying to give the platform for HR and IR leaders across the length and breadth of the country to congregate and try to reach a few useful insights shedding light to what this exciting new future may exactly look like. Further, there will be the brightest HR minds from the best institutions who will enrich the conference with their curiosity, ingenuity and brand new perspectives to view and provide solutions to problems and opportunities of the future.<br/>
                Thus the perfect combination of experienced professionals meeting bright students promises to make this upcoming National HR-IR conference a landmark event as we look to finding the perfect ways to realize the fullest potential of the workforce of the future.
